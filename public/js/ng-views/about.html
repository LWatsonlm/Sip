<h2>$ip was created with the frugal in mind.</h2>
<h3>DC is an expensive city and it's not getting cheaper.</h3>

<p class="lead">Spending 14 weeks unemployed, going out on a budget was hard. So I thought, where are all of the deals in DC? And $ip was born.</p>
<p class="lead">$ip will only show you bottomless drink specials for <strong>under $15.</strong> In most cases, the drink special is FREE!</p>
<br />
<h3>$ip is still in progress. Stay tuned!</h3>
