<h2>$ip was created with the frugal in mind.</h2>
<h3>DC is an expensive city and it's not getting cheaper.</h3>

<p class="lead">
  Going out on a budget is hard. After spending 14 weeks unemployed while attending General Assembly, going out is almost impossible without busting your budget for the week.</p>
<p class="lead">
  Every night, my friends and I researched bars with the best drink specials. The number one question in mind... where are all of the drink specials?
  <strong>And $ip was born.</strong>
</p>


<p class="lead">$ip will only show you bottomless drink specials that are <strong>under $15.</strong> In most cases, the drink special is FREE!</p>

<br />

<h3>$ip is still in progress. Stay tuned!</h3>
